    "# Illustration of importance sampling for GHZ states\n",
    "\n",
    "The script evalates the purity ${[p_2]}_{IS}$ of noisy GHZ states by performing importance sampling of the local random unitaries from the ideal pure GHZ state as proposed in https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.13524.pdf .\n",
    "We also provide comparisons to the old protocol of uniform sampling of the random unitaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to estimate the purity $p_{2}$ of a large $N$ qubit noisy GHZ state prepared in a NISQ device. \n",
    "\n",
    "-> We sample the 'important' unitaries from ideal GHZ state. This is done with the help of a metropolis algorithm that samples local unitaries from the probability distribution $p_\\mathrm{IS}(u)$ contructed from the pure GHZ state function $X_\\mathrm{GHZ}(u)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "-> We perform randomized measurements with $N_u$ such sampled unitaries and collect $N_M$ readout measurements for each applied unitary.\n",
    "\n",
    "-> The unbiased estimator for each applied $u^{(r)}$ with $r = 1, \\dots, N_u$, is contructed from Eq.(3): $X_e(u^{(r)}) = \\frac{2^N}{N_M(N_M-1)}\n",
    "    \\sum_{m \\neq m'} (-2) ^{-D[s_m^{(r)},s^{(r)}_{m'}]}$ \n",
    "    \n",
    "-> The purity ${[p_2]}_{IS}$ is computed as a weighted average over the applied unitaries Eq.(15) given by:\n",
    "   $[p_2]_\\mathrm{IS} = \\frac{ 1}{N_s}\n",
