Code to reconstruct the purity of artifically generated randomized measurement data of a N qubit syste (https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.120.050406,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/364/6437/|, https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.99.052323 ).

- Realize a quantum state $$\rho$$ in a qubit system
- Apply $$N_u$$ random unitaries made of single qubit rotations, measure for each unitary $$N_M$$ bitstrings $$k_{s=1,..,N_M}$$.
