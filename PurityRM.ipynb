    "The script [PurityImportanceSampling](PurityImportanceSampling.py) shows how to access the purity $p_2=\\mathrm{Tr}(\\rho^2)$ based on importance sampling of randomized Measurements [link to the paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.13524.pdf). \n",

    "In this example we consider an experiment where we would like to implement a large $N$-qubit GHZ state\n",

    "However, due to decoherence, we realize instead a mixed-state of the form\n",

    "\n",
    "In order to reduce the required number of measuremens, we can use importance sampling and sample unitaries non-uniformly. As we know that the state $\\rho$ is closed to the pure state state $|\\mathrm{GHZ}\\rangle$, which was targeted, we can define a probability distribution\n",
